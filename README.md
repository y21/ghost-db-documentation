# ghost-db-documentation
An unofficial markdown documentation for Chadsoft's ghost leaderboard API.

## About
Unfortunately the <a href="http://chadsoft.co.uk/time-trials/">CTGP-R Ghost Database API</a> is undocumented and no one has made a documentation for it yet, so I decided it would be helpful for developers in the mario kart wii community to write one, so people can use the api in their application without any problems.

## Issues
If you have questions about CTGP-R or mario kart wii in general, you should not open an issue. You might want to consider contacting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBean35000vr">MrBean</a> or Chadderz (founders of CTGP-R) if your problem/question is related to CTGP. You should **only** open issues about the documentation and the API itself.
